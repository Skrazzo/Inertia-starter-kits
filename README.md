# Install

Clone the repository and open terminal in the cloned directory.

Here's commands for setting up Laravel back-end:
```sh
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

After configurating .env file run
```sh
php artisan migrate
```

Now we need to install everything for React front-end:
```sh
npm i
```

That's all, for front-end you will need to run Vite, with `npm run dev` and back-end with `php artisan serve` and you will be able to access React on **localhost:8000** ( default Laravel port )

**Happy Hacking !**
